## Secure Payload Encoding with Salt (Python)
This Python script allows you to encode a payload using a secret salt key and index, ensuring it remains inaccessible if incorrect credentials are used for decoding.

# Features:

Encodes payloads with a salt key and index for added security.
Decodes payloads using the same salt key and index.
Returns error messages for invalid encoded payloads or incorrect decoding credentials.
Utilizes base64 encoding for efficient storage and transmission.
Installation:

This script requires the base64 and hashlib libraries. You can install them using pip:

``` bash
pip install base64 hashlib
```

## Usage:

Clone or download this repository.
Update payload, salt_key, and salt_index in the script with your desired values.
Run the script to encode and decode your payload.

## Example:
```bash
Replace with your payload, salt key, and index
payload = "This is a secret message"
salt_key = "your_secret_salt_key"
salt_index = 123

# Encode and decode the payload
encoded_payload = encode_payload(payload, salt_key, salt_index)
decoded_payload = decode_payload(encoded_payload, salt_key, salt_index)

print(decoded_payload)  # Should print "This is a secret message"
```
